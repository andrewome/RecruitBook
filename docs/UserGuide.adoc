== Introduction

[big]#*Welcome to RecruitBook User Guide!*#

RecruitBook v1.4 is an offline desktop application that allows you to manage job candidates and job offers
throughout the process of recruiting. Designed specifically to ease the recruitment process, you can use RecruitBook
to add, edit, find, filter, shortlist, email and delete candidates, as well as job offers, to help you efficiently link
potential candidates to the job offer that is best suited for them.

RecruitBook is optimized for people who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), while enjoying the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). RecruitBook can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

RecruitBook is available for the Linux, Unix, Windows XP, and Mac OS X operating systems.

== About
This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the RecruitBook installation process, the step-by-step instructions for its features,
and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). In addition, <<Quick Start>> provides an end-to-end setup process to get you started.

In order to understand the step-by-step instructions, it is important to know the difference between Command Line Interface (CLI) and
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

|=====================================================
|Command Line Interface (CLI) |Entering commands via keyboard input into the command box.
|Graphical User Interface (GUI) |Clicking on-screen via mouse input.
|=====================================================

== Quick Start

[[Features]]
== Features
Before you get started on the features, there is a certain command format that RecruitBook
follows.
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the fields to be specified by *you*.
[TIP]
In `addc n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addc n/John Doe`.

* Details labelled with *“if any”* [underline]#_must_# be filled in at least with *`NA`* if you find it not applicable.
* Parameters can be in [green]#*any*# order.
[TIP]
If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also [green]#_acceptable_#.
